It utilizes particle coordinates estimated by the spot detection algorithm and intensities from associated image-planes to extract intensity values and estimate background, noise and SNR associated with the area immediately surrounding each bright spot. Specifically, the algorithm first determines the global background and noise associated with the entire image plane where each particle is localized. It then utilizes the particle size as defined by the user to draw a square area around each particleâ€™s centroid and identify the brightest pixel within the particle area. Finally it estimates local noise, background and SNR based on the Bhattacharya Poisson, the Bhattacharya Gaussian and the Cheezum SNR models. After calculating local SNR values, the algorithm returns aggregate SNR values at the trajectory, plane and image level.";
