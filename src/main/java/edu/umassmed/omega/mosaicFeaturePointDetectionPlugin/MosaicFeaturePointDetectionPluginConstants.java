It simply is the particle detection part of the Mosaic particle tracker, without the linking.  It handles time-series and video data and can be handy in an image-processing pipeline or macro where only detection is needed. Alternatively, it can be compared with other spot detection algorithms or combined with different linkers to optimize a tracking workflow.";
