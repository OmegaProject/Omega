Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102:15110â€“15115. doi:10.1073/pnas.0504407102). In addition, it provides an easy to use graphical user interface to plot such measures for each individual trajectory. Finally it utilizes a scatter plot to summarize the data and display the diffusion coefficient (D2) and the slope of the moment scaling spectrum (SMSS) of all trajectories in a dataset in a single plot. Individual trajectories are represented as single points in this D2 vs. SMSS phase space, allowing to globally evaluate the behavior of 'clouds' of trajectories and compare the effect of different experimental conditions on their shapes.";
